# louie-zong

A (hopefully nicely aesethic) website made to collate a bunch of social media information for louie zhong!

Mostly a testing ground for seeing if a social media collater site can be generalised enough to create a expandable template/tool.
... But also cause i love louie zhong and wanted to see if i could build him a kick ass site.


## TODO

- [X] Decide on title font
- [X] Set up Basic Nav Bar + finish Landing
- [X] Update font sizes based on screen size (get landing working on mobile)
- [ ] scroll down animation (move navbar from center to top and smallify title)
       - Perhaps just have size of landing div decrease with scroll
- [ ] Set up about section (with smooth scroll from navbar + navbar highlight)
- [ ] Set up social media summary cards. (get flex working on them)
- [ ] Load in animation (nav elements fan out)
