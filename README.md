# louie-zong

A (hopefully nicely aesethic) website made to collate a bunch of social media information for louie zhong!

Mostly a testing ground for seeing if a social media collater site can be generalised enough to create a expandable template/tool.
... But also cause i love louie zhong and wanted to see if i could build him a kick ass site.


## TODO

- [X] Decide on title font
- [ ] Set up Basic Nav Bar + finish Landing
- [ ] Update font sizes based on screen size (get landing working on mobile)
- [ ] Set up social media summary cards. (get flex working on them)
